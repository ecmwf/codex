# Forking other repositories

External collaborators of ECMWF are expected to fork our repositories and then make a pull request from their fork. Likewise if we wish to contribute to other repositories, we often need to create a fork. This fork should exist in ECMWF GitHub but we want to take care that we distinguish it from code we own.

## Process

1. Fork the repository. It will be public and cannot be changed.
2. Create a new branch, which shall be empty except for a readme.md. The branch can be called `default`. Follow the template below.
3. Make that branch the default branch, so that it is the page most people land on.
4. In the repository settings, disable all actions, because we don't know what workflows we just imported, and they would now have access to internal systems and organisation secrets.


## Readme Template

> This is a fork of <repository name> for preparing contributions by ECMWF before pushing them to the upstream repo. ECMWF aims to synchronise this repo regularly with the upstream repo. Please go to the original repo linked below for further information about <repository name>.

The remainder of the readme can describe the original project or any particular modifications ECMWF have made, or can be left blank.
