# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

> [!TIP]
> Write here the "mission statement" of the project.
> It should be a short paragraph that describes the purpose of the project (why have we built this?) and what it does. It should be written in a way that is easy to understand for someone who is not familiar with the project.


# Features

> [!TIP]
> Ideally a bullet-point list of the key features. You can go into a bit more detail here. Try to capture _why_ this software is unique.

- **Foo**: It has Foo
- **Bar**: It has Bar

# Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> Each repository should contain a quick-start guide, which shows the quickest possible path to get something working with this package.
> Ideally a code block which can be just copy-pasted.

# Installation

{% if cookiecutter.language == 'cpp' -%}

{{ cookiecutter.project_name }} employs an out-of-source build/install based on CMake.

srcdir=$(pwd)
builddir=build
installdir=$HOME/.local

# 1. Create the build directory:
mkdir $builddir
cd $builddir

# 2. Run CMake
ecbuild --prefix=$installdir -- $srcdir

# 3. Compile / Install
make -j10
make install

# 4. Check installation
$installdir/bin/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}-version
```
