# Maturity Levels of Software

Software maturity refers to the stages a software project goes through during its lifecycle. 

# Graduated

Graduated projects are ready for operations, and typically used by ECMWF and/or its Member and Cooperating states in operations. This does not mean we give operational support to the software itself.

# Incubating

Incubating projects are mostly feature-complete and the interface is mostly stable. However, they are still under development and should not be used for operational or time-critical applications.

# Emerging

Emerging projects are in the early stages of development. There is a clear project goal, but they are not yet feature-complete and not stable.

# Sandbox

Sandbox projects are experimental, proof-of-concept. Expect frequent changes, incomplete features and instability.

# Archived

Projects that have reached the end of their lifecycle.
They are no longer actively maintained or developed. 
These projects may still be available for reference or historical purposes, but they should not be used for any active development or operational purposes.
