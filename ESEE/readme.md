# The ECMWF Software EnginE (ESEE)

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is developing the **ECMWF Software EnginE** (ESEE, pronounced "easy"), a flexible and interoperable software ecosystem designed for extreme-scale simulations, data fusion, data handling, data services, and machine learning.

ESEE is not a monolithic platform but a **set of opt-in components that work together seamlessly**, following a shared set of core data management principles. This modular approach allows users to integrate the parts that best suit their needs while ensuring interoperability across ECMWF services, Member and Cooperating States, and the broader Earth System community.

ESEE provides the essential infrastructure needed to support cutting-edge scientific workflows at scaleâ€”delivering efficiency, adaptability, and performance where it matters most.

ESEE components are split into **four sub-categories**:

## Production Chain

ESEE Production Chain encompasses components that drive the execution of operational and research workflows, managing complex dependencies, scheduling, and processing of data at scale.
