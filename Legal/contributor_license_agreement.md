**CONTRIBUTOR LICENCE AGREEMENT FOR ECMWF SOFTWARE** 

I hereby license any Work, which I contribute now or in the future to ECMWF software, to ECMWF under the licence of the software package, namely Apache License Version 2.0 (see http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.) plus the following terms, which shall prevail if there should be a conflict with the aforementioned Apache License:
 
For the purposes of this Contributor Licence Agreement, "Work" means any original work of authorship and/or any modifications or additions to an existing work, that I intentionally submit for inclusion in the software package. This includes, but is not limited to, source code, documentation, configuration files, and any other materials necessary or useful for the development, maintenance, or use of the software package.
 
1) I hereby warrant that:
 
    a) I am entitled to grant this licence as “Licensor” because I am either the copyright owner or because the copyright owner has given me full authority to act on his/her/its behalf, including but not limited to submit the Work with any modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the terms and conditions as described in this Contributor Licence Agreement;
 
    b) The Work is an original work of authorship and has not been copied wholly or partly from any other source;
 
    c) If the Work is not an original work of authorship:
    
    c.1) I have submitted such Work separately from any other Work that is an original work of authorship
    
    c.2) I have clearly identified in my submission all required attributions and notices, the complete details of its source, and the licence information and other restrictions (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and licence agreements); and
 
    d) To the best of my knowledge, the Work does not violate any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights either on its own or in conjunction with ECMWF software;
 
    e) I have provided express details, to the best of my knowledge, of any and all third-party rights (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) in the Work, which may affect or restrict ECMWF’s use of the Work;
 
2. I acknowledge that the Work will be publicly available, and that records of the Work (including my name and email address) may be permanently maintained as part of the software package public history for the purposes of recording authorship and may be redistributed with the software package.
 
3. I agree to notify ECMWF promptly if I become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make the above warranties and representations inaccurate in any respect.
 
4. I am aware that ECMWF is an inter-governmental organisation. Any dispute in relation to this license shall be resolved amicably or by final and binding arbitration by one arbitrator under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce sitting in London, United Kingdom, and conducted in English. Recourse to courts is excluded. Nothing in these terms is meant to be construed as a waiver of any of the privileges and immunities conferred upon ECMWF.
