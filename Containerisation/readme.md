# Best Practices for Containerization

## Why Containerize?

* Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
* Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
* Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
* Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
* And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

## Workflow

* Skaffold
* Helm
* Kubernetes

## Repository Structure

* Source + Dockerfile + skaffold.yaml
* Chart
* Config

## CI/CD
